# US 3.1.3 - Role-Based Menu Visibility

## Descrição

As a System User with a specific role, I want the SPA to show only the menus relevant to my permissions, so that the interface remains clear and I can only access allowed features.

## Critérios de Aceitação

- Menu options must be rendered dynamically based on the logged-authenticated user's role.
- Navigation to unauthorized sections must be prevented (even if manually typed in the URL).
