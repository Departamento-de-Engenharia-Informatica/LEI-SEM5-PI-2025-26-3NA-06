# US 2.2.8 - Create/Submit Vessel Visit Notification

## Descrição

As a Shipping Agent Representative, I want to create/submit a Vessel Visit Notification, so that the vessel berthing and subsequent (un)loading operations at the port are scheduled and planned in space and timely manner.

## Critérios de Aceitação

- The Cargo Manifest data for unloading and/or loading is included.
- The system must validate that referred containers identifiers comply with the ISO 6346:2022 standard.
- Information about the crew (name, citizen id, nationality) might be requested, when necessary, for compliance with security protocols.
- Vessel Visit Notifications might become at an "in progress" status (e.g. cargo information is incomplete) to be further update/completed.
- When completed / ready for asking approval, the agent is required to change its state to "submitted".
