2.4. ADDITIONAL REMARKS - MANDATORY SCOPE OF WORK
================================================================================

Considering the initial phase of the project and the existence of teams of varying sizes (due to distinct number of members), it is necessary to take measures to reduce the risk associated with successful project development. To this end, Table 1 presents the mandatory scope of work for each team member (marked with an "X").

TABLE 1. MANDATORY SCOPE OF WORK FOR EVERY TEAM MEMBER

Scope of Work (by Main Concept) | Member 1 | Member 2 | Member 3 | Member 4 | Member 5
----------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------
Dock                              |          | X        |          |          |
Qualification                     |          |          | X        | X        |
Resource                          |          |          | X        |          |
Shipping Agent Organization       |          |          |          |          | X
Shipping Agent Representative     |          |          |          |          | X
Staff Member                      |          |          |          | X        |
Storage Area                      | X        | X        | X        | X        |
Vessel                            | X        |          |          |          |
Vessel Type                       |          | X        | X        |          |
Vessel Visit Notification         | X        | X        | X        | X        | X

According to this table, for example, the first team member is solely responsible for the functionalities involving the Vessel concept and shares (equally) responsibilities with the second team member regarding the functionalities involving the Vessel Type concept. Furthermore, (s)he assumes shared responsibilities with the other team members regarding Storage Area and Vessel Visit Notification.

A similar analysis should be performed for the remaining team members.

When the team lacks a member (e.g., the fifth and, in some cases, also the fourth), the solely responsibilities of the absent members may not be fulfilled by the team. However, the team must ensure that the remaining responsibilities, that is, the responsibilities shared with the absent members, are fulfilled.

By complying with these general rules, the team is ensuring a smooth running of the project for sprint B and C.
