# US 4.1.3 - Search and List Operation Plans

## Descrição

As a Logistics Operator, I want to search and list Operation Plans for a given day or period, so that I can quickly review all scheduled activities within that timeframe.

## Critérios de Aceitação

- The REST API must support querying Operation Plans by date range and/or vessel identifier.
- The SPA must provide a searchable and filterable table showing plan summaries (e.g., vessel, dock, start/end time, assigned resources).
- Results must be sortable (e.g., by start time, vessel name, or expected delay).
