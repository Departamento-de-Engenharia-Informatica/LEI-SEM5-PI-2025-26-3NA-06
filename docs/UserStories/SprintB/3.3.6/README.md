# US 3.3.6 - Perspective Camera Control

## Descrição

As a System User, I want to control a perspective camera using the mouse, so that I can freely explore the scene and inspect objects from different angles.

## Critérios de Aceitação

- Mouse right-click-and-drag allows orbiting the camera around the scene's current target.
- Mouse wheel allows dollying-in and -out within safe limits.
- Movements must feel responsive and smooth, without jitter or excessive sensitivity.
