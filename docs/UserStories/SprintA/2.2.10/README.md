# US 2.2.10 - View Vessel Visit Notification Status

## Descrição

## Critérios de Aceitação

- The Shipping Agent Representative may also view the status of Vessel Visit Notifications submitted by other representatives working for the same shipping agent organization.
- Vessel Visit Notifications must be searchable and filterable by vessel, status, representative and time.
