# US 2.2.7 - Review Vessel Visit Notifications (Approve/Reject)

## Descrição

As a Port Authority Officer, I want to review pending Vessel Visit Notifications and approve or reject them, so that docking schedules remain under port control.

## Critérios de Aceitação

- When a notification is approved, the officer must assign a (temporarily) dock on which the vessel should berth.
- When a notification is rejected, the officer must provide a reason for rejection (e.g., information is missing).
- If rejected, the shipping agent representative might review / update the notification for further new decision.
- All decisions (approve/reject) must be logged with timestamp, officer ID, and decision outcome for auditing purposes.
