SPRINT B OVERVIEW
Sprint B focuses on extending the prototype into a modular, integrated, and operationally viable system. 
Work is structured around seven key areas: 
(i) developing a unified Front-end Application (SPA); 
(ii) enforcing secure Authentication and Authorization across both front-end and back-end components; 
(iii) introducing a 3D Visualization module synchronized with live system data; 
(iv) initiating the Scheduling and Planning engine to support operational decision-making; 
(v) exploiting some Systems Administration best practices and establishing some Business Continuity (BC) foundations; 
(vi) reinforcing GDPR awareness and data protection responsibility; 
(vii) extending the Project Client Analysis with deeper insights into managerial, operational, and sustainability practices.

Together, these efforts aim to deliver not only functional capabilities, but also security, resilience, compliance, and contextual understanding of the target business environment.

As a System User, I want the system to automatically load my internal authorization role after authentication, so that I gain access only to my permitted features.

Acceptance Criteria / Comments:
• After IAM login, the SPA must call a backend endpoint to retrieve the user's assigned role and render the respective menu options.
• If the user has no assigned role or it is inactive, access must be denied with an appropriate message.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• When authorizing a user for the first time:
  o A unique activation link is sent to their email.
  o By default, the users are set to a "deactivated" status.
• Internal roles determine system access level.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

US 3.2.6 - User Activation via Link
As a System User receiving an activation link, I want to complete my first access securely through authentication, so that I can start using the system.

Acceptance Criteria / Comments:
• The activation link redirects the user to authenticate via IAM.
• Once authenticated, the system must confirm that the authenticated user data matches the user identity related to the link being used:
  o In case of success, the system completes the activation process (status update).
  o Otherwise, an error must be presented, preventing system access.
• Expired or invalid links must show an error message.
• After activation, the user gains role-based access.

Acceptance Criteria / Comments:
• The module must expose its algorithms / functionalities through a REST-based API.
• The module must consume existing data from other back-end services via their exposed APIs (e.g., staff, resources).
• The module must not persist operational data — it only computes and returns scheduling results upon request.
• Input and output payloads must follow JSON format and use consistent identifiers with other modules (e.g., resource IDs).
• The module API must be properly documented (e.g. via OpenAPI/Swagger) and accessible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

US 3.4.2 - Generate Daily Schedule
As a Logistics Operator, I want to generate a daily schedule for the loading and unloading operations of vessels arriving at the port on a given day, so that delays relative to desired departure times are minimized.

Acceptance Criteria / Comments:
• The objective of the scheduling algorithm is to minimize total delay between the actual completion and desired departure times of vessels.
• Currently, the scheduling algorithm must only consider:
  a. One vessel per dock at a time.
  b. One crane (system) per unloading/loading operation.
  c. One storage location for the unloading/loading operations.
  d. Availability of physical resources (crane) and qualified staff within their operational windows.
• The scheduling computation must be executed through the Planning & Scheduling back-end module, which consumes the required data (e.g., vessel arrivals/departures, resources, staff data) from other APIs.
• The scheduling process must be initiated through a dedicated interface on the SPA. This UI must:
  a. Allow the operator to specify the target date (day).
  b. Display the results in a summary table (e.g., vessel, start/end time, assigned crane, staff) and, if feasible, through a timeline approach.
  c. Provide feedback on progress and completion, including warnings about infeasibility (e.g., lack of resources or staff).
• At this stage, results do not need to be persisted anywhere— they can be recomputed on demand.

• The algorithm's complexity class must be explained and justified.
• The findings must be summarized in a short technical report to support further optimization or heuristic development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

US 3.4.4 - Alternative Heuristic Algorithm
As a Logistics Operator, I want an alternative scheduling algorithm for the loading and unloading operations of vessels arriving at the port on a given day, that produces a good (but not necessarily optimal) solution efficiently, so that the system can handle larger problem instances or time-constrained planning scenarios.

Acceptance Criteria / Comments:
• This algorithm must be available for selection on the dedicated interface of the SPA and reuse the same data inputs and interfaces defined for the existing scheduling module.
• This algorithm must aim to minimize vessel departure delays but prioritize computational efficiency over optimality. Suitable approaches may include greedy strategies, local search, or other informed heuristics.
• Results must be comparable (e.g., total delay, computation time) against the previous algorithm using summary metrics.
• At this stage, results do not need to be persisted anywhere— they can be recomputed on demand.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

US 3.4.5 - Multi-Crane Support
As a Logistics Operator, I want the scheduling module to support the use of multiple cranes when a single-crane solution cannot eliminate vessel departure delays, so that total delay is minimized while using additional cranes only when strictly necessary.

Acceptance Criteria / Comments:
• The system must first attempt to generate a schedule using a single-crane allocation strategy.
• If the computed schedule still results in non-zero departure delays, the module must (automatically or optionally) re-evaluate the plan allowing multiple cranes per vessel.
• The multi-crane scheduling approach must aim to:
  o Minimize the total sum of vessel departure delays.
  o Minimize the additional time windows where more than one crane is required (i.e., minimize multi-crane usage intensity).
• The output must clearly indicate where and when additional cranes were allocated to meet schedule objectives.
• The operator must be able to compare results between single-crane and multi-crane strategies via summary metrics (e.g., total delay, number of crane-hours used).
• At this stage, results do not need to be persisted anywhere— they can be recomputed on demand.
