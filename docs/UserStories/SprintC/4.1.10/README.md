# US 4.1.10 - Search and List VVEs

## Descrição

As a Logistics Operator, I want to search and list VVEs over a given period or for a specific vessel, so that I can review execution history and analyze performance.

## Critérios de Aceitação

- The REST API must support filtering VVEs by date range, vessel, or execution status.
- The SPA must present this data in a tabular or timeline view.
- Results must include key execution metrics (e.g., total turnaround time, berth occupancy time, waiting time for berthing, delays in arrival, departures and operations).
