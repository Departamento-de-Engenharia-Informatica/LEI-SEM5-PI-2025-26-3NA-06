SPRINT C OVERVIEW
Sprint C focuses on evolving the decoupled system architecture and consolidating the existing core functional modules into a cohesive operational solution. 

In this sprint, a new Operations & Execution Management (OEM) module is introduced, while enhancing the Single-Page Application, the 3D visualization environment, and the Intelligent Scheduling and Planning Algorithms. Business Continuity and System Administration capabilities are also reinforced. 

Additionally, GDPR compliance and project client analysis are addressed to ensure the solution meets legal, operational, technological, and organizational expectations.

================================================================================
4.1. OPERATIONS & EXECUTION MANAGEMENT (OEM)
================================================================================

The Operations & Execution Management (OEM) module is responsible for managing execution data of port activities. It bridges the gap between operations planning and operations execution, allowing the system to record what actually happens during each vessel visit and how it differs from the planned schedule.

Among others, this module aims to support:
• Operation Plans – CRUD for storing and updating scheduling results generated by the Planning & Scheduling component (i.e. the planned cargo operations).
• Vessel Visit Executions (VVE) – recording actual vessel arrivals, departures, and the real execution of cargo operations.
• Incidents & Incident Types – managing unexpected events or disruptions affecting operations and their classification.
• Complementary Tasks & Categories – logging non-cargo-related activities (e.g., inspections, maintenance, cleaning) that may occur during vessel visits and impact operational efficiency.

Collected data can later be used for analytics, reporting, and performance evaluation (e.g., comparing planned vs. actual execution times, identifying frequent delays, or analyzing incident impact).

US 4.1.1 - Develop OEM as Independent Service
As a Project Manager, I want the team to develop Operations & Execution Management (OEM) module as an independent back-end service so that the system architecture remains modular, decentralized, and maintainable, allowing each component to evolve independently while ensuring seamless integration with existing modules.

Acceptance Criteria / Comments:
• This module must follow architectural good practices.
• It must expose a REST-based API with endpoints for CRUD operations on all managed business concepts.
• The API must be properly documented (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI).
• Inter-module communication must occur exclusively via REST API calls — no direct database access.
• Authentication and authorization must be integrated and comply with the IAM-based, RBAC and ABAC approaches taken in Sprint B.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

US 4.1.2 - Generate and Store Operation Plans
As a Logistics Operator, I want to automatically generate and store Operation Plans for all Vessel Visit Notifications (VVNs) scheduled for a given day using one of the available scheduling algorithms, so that cargo operations are efficiently organized and can later be monitored or adjusted.

Acceptance Criteria / Comments:
• The operator must be able to select a target day for which Operation Plans will be generated.
• Operation Plans are generated by the Planning & Scheduling module, using the selected algorithm:
  o An Operation Plan aggregates all the (sequence of) operations related to a VVN.
  o Each plan must include, among others, the assigned resources, planned time windows for loading/unloading.
• The SPA must allow operators to initiate and view generated plans before saving them in the OEM module.
• For auditability purposes, the system must record some metadata such as creation date, author, algorithm used.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

US 4.1.3 - Search and List Operation Plans
As a Logistics Operator, I want to search and list Operation Plans for a given day or period, so that I can quickly review all scheduled activities within that timeframe.

• Changes must be validated and logged (date, author, reason for change).
• The system must alert the user if the updated plans introduce possible inconsistencies with related VVNs and resource availability (e.g., cranes or staff).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

US 4.1.5 - Identify VVNs Without Operation Plans
As a Logistics Operator, I want to identify Vessel Visit Notifications (VVNs) that do not yet have an Operation Plan, so that missing plans can be easily detected and generated.

Acceptance Criteria / Comments:
• The REST API must include an endpoint returning VVNs without an associated Operation Plan.
• The SPA must display these VVNs in a dedicated section or tab ("Missing Plans").
• If one or more VVNs of a given day are missing an Operation Plan, the operator must be able to trigger regeneration of all Operation Plans for that day using the selected scheduling algorithm.
• For regenerated plans, the system must record some metadata such as creation date, author, algorithm used.
• Operators must be warned that regeneration plans will overwrite any existing plans for that day as soon as they are confirmed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

US 4.1.6 - Query Resource Allocation Time
As a Logistics Operator, I want to query, for a given period, the total allocation time of a specific resource (e.g., crane, dock, or staff), so that I can assess resource utilization and workload distribution.

Acceptance Criteria / Comments:
• The REST API must provide endpoints aggregating Operation Plan data by resource and period.
• Returned data must include total allocated time and number of operations.
• The SPA must display results in a summary table.
• Data must only include saved Operation Plans.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

US 4.1.7 - Create Vessel Visit Execution (VVE) Record

Acceptance Criteria / Comments:
• The REST API must allow creating a new VVE referencing an existing VVN.
• Recorded fields must include vessel identifier, actual arrival time at the port, and creator user ID. An automatic VVE identifier must be also assigned, whose pattern is like VVN IDs.
• The SPA must easy the VVE creation using available VVN information.
• Once created, the VVE must be marked as "In Progress."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

US 4.1.8 - Update VVE with Berth Time and Dock
As a Logistics Operator, I want to update an in progress VVE with the actual berth time and dock used, so that discrepancies from the planned dock assignment are recorded.

Acceptance Criteria / Comments:
• The REST API must support update of berth time and dock ID.
• If the assigned dock differs from the planned one, a warning or note must be automatically added.
• All updates must be timestamped and logged for auditability.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

US 4.1.9 - Update VVE with Executed Operations
As a Logistics Operator, I want to update an in progress VVE with executed operations, so that the system reflects real execution progress and performance.

Acceptance Criteria / Comments:
• Executed operations (mainly) derive from planned operations, which may be used to easy recording execution of operations.
• The SPA must allow the operator to confirm or modify start/end times and resource usage.
• The corresponding planned operations must be marked as "started," "completed," or "delayed."
• Execution updates must be stored with timestamps and operator ID.
• Completion status must synchronize with the corresponding Operation Plan for comparison.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a Logistics Operator, I want to search and list VVEs over a given period or for a specific vessel, so that I can review execution history and analyze performance.

Acceptance Criteria / Comments:
• The REST API must support filtering VVEs by date range, vessel, or execution status.
• The SPA must present this data in a tabular or timeline view.
• Results must include key execution metrics (e.g., total turnaround time, berth occupancy time, waiting time for berthing, delays in arrival, departures and operations).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

US 4.1.11 - Mark VVE as Completed
As a Logistics Operator, I want to mark a VVE as completed by recording the vessel's unberth time and port departure time, so that the visit lifecycle is correctly closed and operational statistics can be derived.

Acceptance Criteria / Comments:
• The SPA must provide an option to mark a VVE as "Completed."
• To complete a VVE, the following information must be recorded:
  o Actual unberth time (when the vessel leaves the dock).
  o Actual port departure time (when the vessel exits port limits).
• Completion is only allowed if all associated cargo operations are recorded as finished.
• Once completed, the VVE becomes read-only, except for authorized corrections by admin users.
• The action must be logged (timestamp, user, any changes made) for audit purposes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

US 4.1.12 - Manage Incident Types Catalog
As a Port Authority Officer, I want to manage the catalog of Incident Types so that the classification of operational disruptions remains standardized, hierarchical, and clearly distinct from complementary tasks.

Acceptance Criteria / Comments:
• The system must support hierarchical structuring of incident types (e.g., Fog is a subtype of Environmental Conditions), allowing grouping and filtering by parent type.
• CRUD operations for Incident Types must be available via the REST API.
• The SPA must provide an intuitive interface for listing, filtering, and managing these hierarchy of types.
• Each Incident Type must include a unique code (e.g., T-INC001), a name (e.g., Equipment Failure), a detailed description, a severity classification (e.g., Minor, Major, Critical).
• Examples of possible types:
  o Environmental Conditions: Fog, Strong Winds, Heavy Rain
  o Operational Failures: Crane Malfunction, Power Outage
  o Safety/Security Events: Security Alert

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• The SPA must allow:
  o Filtering and listing incidents by vessel, date range, severity, or status (active/resolved).
  o Quickly associating or detaching affected VVEs.
  o Highlighting active incidents that are currently impacting operations.
• Each incident record must include: a unique generated ID, a reference to its Incident Type, start and end timestamps (allowing ongoing incidents to be marked as active), a severity level (e.g., minor, major, critical), a free-text description, a responsible user (the creator).
• An incident may affect: (i) all ongoing VVEs; (ii) specific VVEs (manually selected); or (iii) upcoming VVEs (planned for later execution on the same day or period).
• When an incident is marked as resolved (i.e., end time is set), its duration must be computed automatically.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

US 4.1.14 - Manage Complementary Task Categories
