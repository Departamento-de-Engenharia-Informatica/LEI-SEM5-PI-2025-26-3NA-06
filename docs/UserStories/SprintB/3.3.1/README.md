# US 3.3.1 - Develop and Integrate 3D Module

## Descrição

As a Project Manager, I want the team to develop and integrate a 3D visualization module into the SPA, so that users can begin interacting with a visual representation of the port environment.

## Critérios de Aceitação

- The 3D engine (e.g., Three.js, WebGL) must be embedded, as a component, in the SPA.
- The 3D module must load as part of the existing SPA routing and layout (cf. US 3.1.2).
- The integration must not break the existing UI or authentication flow.
- The source code of the 3D module must be integrated into the existing repository structure.
