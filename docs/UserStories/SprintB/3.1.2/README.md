# US 3.1.2 - Unified Layout

## Descrição

As a System User, I want the SPA to provide a unified layout, so that navigation is consistent across the application.

## Critérios de Aceitação

- The application layout must include at minimum:
  - A header bar containing the system/company logo and name.
  - A designated area for primary navigation (e.g., top menu, side menu, or equivalent).
  - These two elements must always be visible, in any circumstance.
- The layout may optionally include:
  - Secondary navigation elements, such as submenus or breadcrumbs.
  - A sidebar, footer, or other auxiliary interface sections to enhance usability.
- Menu options must be rendered dynamically based on the logged-authenticated user's role.
- UI styling must follow a consistent design system/component library.
- It must have multilingual support (e.g.: English and Portuguese).
- The layout must adapt to different screen sizes (desktop orientation first; tablet/mobile support may be planned).
