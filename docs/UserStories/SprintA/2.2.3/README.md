# US 2.2.3 - Register and Update Docks

## Descrição

As a Port Authority Officer, I want to register and update docks, so that the system accurately reflects the docking capacity of the port.

## Critérios de Aceitação

- A dock record must include a unique identifier, name/number, location within the port, and physical characteristics (e.g., length, depth, max draft).
- The officer must specify the vessel types allowed to berth there.
- Docks must be searchable and filterable by name, vessel type, and location.
