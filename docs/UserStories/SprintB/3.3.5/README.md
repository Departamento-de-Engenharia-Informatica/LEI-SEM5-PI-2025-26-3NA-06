# US 3.3.5 - Appropriate Lighting

## Descrição

As a System User, I want the 3D scene to have appropriate lighting, so that objects are clearly visible, realistically rendered, and easy to interpret in different viewing conditions.

## Critérios de Aceitação

- The scene must include at least ambient and directional lighting to ensure visibility of all 3D objects.
- Lighting should enhance depth perception and object contours without causing overexposure or darkness.
- Shadows or highlights must be used without causing significant performance degradation.
- The illumination setup must work consistently across zoom levels and camera angles.
