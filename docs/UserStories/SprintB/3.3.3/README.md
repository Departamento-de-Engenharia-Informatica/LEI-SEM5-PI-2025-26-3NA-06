# US 3.3.3 - Display Vessels and Major Resources

## Descrição

As a Logistics Operator or Port Authority Officer, I want to see vessels and major resources (e.g., ship-to-shore cranes, yard gantry cranes) displayed in the 3D environment, so that I can visualize operational elements.

## Critérios de Aceitação

- Items must appear in default or assigned positions (e.g., docked vessel on its berth).
- The system must fetch required data from the existing REST APIs.
- Regarding resources, consider only those that have an assigned area (e.g. dock A, Yard B).
- Regarding vessels, consider the information on the approved vessel visit notifications only.
- Models representing items can either be procedurally created or imported.
