# US 4.1.2 - Generate and Store Operation Plans

## Descrição

As a Logistics Operator, I want to automatically generate and store Operation Plans for all Vessel Visit Notifications (VVNs) scheduled for a given day using one of the available scheduling algorithms, so that cargo operations are efficiently organized and can later be monitored or adjusted.

## Critérios de Aceitação

- The operator must be able to select a target day for which Operation Plans will be generated.
- Operation Plans are generated by the Planning & Scheduling module, using the selected algorithm:
  - An Operation Plan aggregates all the (sequence of) operations related to a VVN.
  - Each plan must include, among others, the assigned resources, planned time windows for loading/unloading.
- The SPA must allow operators to initiate and view generated plans before saving them in the OEM module.
- For auditability purposes, the system must record some metadata such as creation date, author, algorithm used.
