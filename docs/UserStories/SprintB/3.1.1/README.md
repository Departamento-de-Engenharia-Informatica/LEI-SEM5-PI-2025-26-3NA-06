# US 3.1.1 - Set Up SPA Framework

## Descrição

As a Project Manager, I want the team to set up the SPA using a modern framework, so that future features can be developed in a maintainable way.

## Critérios de Aceitação

- SPA must be built using a framework such as Angular, React or Vue.
- A modular folder structure (e.g., components, services, pages, routing) is required.
- The SPA must adopt a well-founded HTTP client (e.g., Axios/Fetch) for REST API consumption.
