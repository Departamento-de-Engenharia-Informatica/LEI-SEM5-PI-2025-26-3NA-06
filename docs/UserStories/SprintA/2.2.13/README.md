# US 2.2.13 - Register and Manage Qualifications

## Descrição

As a Logistics Operator, I want to register and manage qualifications (create, update), so that staff members and resources can be consistently associated with the correct skills and certifications required for port operations.

## Critérios de Aceitação

- Each qualification has a unique code and a descriptive name (e.g., "STS Crane Operator," "Truck Driver").
- Qualifications must be searchable and filterable by code or name.
- A qualification must exist before it can be assigned to staff members or resources.
