# US 3.1.4 - User Feedback on Actions

## Descrição

As a System User, I want to receive clear feedback when actions succeed or fail in the SPA, so that I understand what happened and can react accordingly.

## Critérios de Aceitação

- Success messages must be shown after completing actions like save, update, or deactivate.
- Validation errors must be shown near the affected input fields.
- Loading indicators must be used during asynchronous operations.
- Errors (e.g. due API calls) must be captured and displayed in a user-friendly format.
